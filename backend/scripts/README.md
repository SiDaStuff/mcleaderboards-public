## Creating New Scripts

1. Create script in `scripts/` directory
2. Add npm script to `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "your-script": "node scripts/your-script.js"
   }
   ```
3. Document in this README

## Best Practices

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Log operations clearly
- Exit with appropriate codes (0 = success, 1 = error)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Test scripts before running in production
- Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations

## Scheduled Tasks

### Using Cron (Linux/Mac)

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Run cleanup daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/backend && npm run cleanup

# Run backup daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/backend && npm run backup
```

### Using Task Scheduler (Windows)

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger (daily, weekly, etc.)
4. Set action: `node` with script path
5. Configure to run in backend directory

### Using PM2 Cron

```bash
pm2 install pm2-cron
pm2 set pm2-cron:cleanup "0 2 * * *"
```
